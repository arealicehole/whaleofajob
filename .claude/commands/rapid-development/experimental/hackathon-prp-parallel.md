# Hackathon PRP Parallel

Creates rapid-fire PRPs optimized for hackathon-style development with parallel processing.

## Usage
`/hackathon-prp-parallel [idea] [timeframe] [tech-stack]`

## Arguments
- `idea`: Core idea or problem to solve
- `timeframe`: Available time (e.g., "48 hours", "weekend")
- `tech-stack`: Preferred technologies or constraints

## Description
This command creates ultra-fast, implementation-ready PRPs specifically designed for hackathons, prototypes, and rapid proof-of-concept development. It prioritizes speed to working prototype over perfect architecture.

## What it does
1. **Rapid Ideation**: Quickly analyzes the core idea and identifies MVP features
2. **Tech Stack Optimization**: Selects optimal technologies for rapid development
3. **Parallel Implementation Planning**: Creates multiple implementation paths simultaneously
4. **Resource Optimization**: Plans for minimal viable implementation
5. **Quick Validation**: Sets up rapid validation and testing strategies

## Example
```
/hackathon-prp-parallel "AI-powered code review bot" "48 hours" "Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API"
```

This will create a rapid-development PRP for building an AI code review bot in 48 hours using the specified tech stack.
